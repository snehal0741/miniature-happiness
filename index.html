        A dress (also known as a frock or a gown) is a garment 
        traditionally worn by women or girls consisting of a skirt
         with an attached bodice (or a matching bodice giving 
         the effect of a one-piece garment). It consists of a top 
         piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs.
